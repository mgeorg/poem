Title: What If?


It's not like I woke up this morning expecting you to be alive.
Yet somehow, I wonder that I mourn and you're not here.
Maybe it's strange that I mourn the passing of so many things not gone.
What a strange thing to expect: to be here.
How can all these moments string together and always expect?
Always expect to be around.

I can imagine it differently.
Some world where all the "what if's" flock together in perfect order.
Maybe that is the world in which I live.
Maybe I just don't see that world, seeing time the way it is.
Maybe all those "what if's" flutter away, on silent wings, whenever I look too close.
Maybe their wings form the thin veil keeping me right here and you right there.
Maybe each moment, stuck in time, is a "what if's" perch.
And, a flock of "what if's," flying in formation, is all of time we ever see.
In their wake, every moment played out, with the fluttering question: "what if?"
