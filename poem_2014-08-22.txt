  Yearning for Reunion

When did we drift apart?
Was it by making things safe?
Banishing me from your world?
Or did I come here willingly?
Finding a place to be free?

We used to be children together.
It's hard to believe we grew up in this town.
How did a thousand different points of view -
Shatter us -
Like rainbow light in broken glass?

I blame you.
And I know, that you blame me.
Today
One of us is right.
But who is to blame
For that final fist fight of our youth?

I tried to come see you.
I tried to stand by you.
but the momentary gesture wasn't enough.
After all, we're still mad.
But, when you look into your daughter's eyes
Do you feel the hole in my heart?
Or did we finally drift apart?
